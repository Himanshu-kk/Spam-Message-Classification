# 📩 Intelligent SMS Spam Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an Intelligent SMS Spam Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) by analyzing text patterns and features extracted from the messages.

---

## 🚀 Features
- SMS text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using vectorization techniques
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Classification of messages into Spam or Ham
- Beginner-friendly and well-structured notebook

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled SMS messages categorized as:
- Spam
- Ham (Non-Spam)

Each message is preprocessed to remove noise and convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
